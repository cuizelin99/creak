<goal>how to line a terra cotta pot to avoid frost damage</goal>
<sol1>Clay pots that have not been completely glazed on the inside are vulnerable to frost damage.

To prevent this, line pots that you want to sit outside all year with heavy-duty plastic. Always buy more plastic liner than you think you need. Push it well down into the pot, and use a pair of scissors to cut out drainage hole in the bottom, removind the entire bottom of the pots linerThen place a layer of pebbles or stones in the base, and fill up with potting mix, the weight of which will push the liner further down. Finally, trim away the excess liner flush with the top of the container.

<sol1>Pencils can become dull quite quickly and if you need to sharpen a point that has become too flat, use a lighter to melt the graphite and then while it is still hot, mold it back into a point by placing it against something metallic for a few seconds.

<sol2>Pencils are made of wood with a relatively soft material called graphite which is what leaves the markings. Once the tip has become worn down, you can simply run the pencil along one side repeatedly, and this will sharpen up a dull point. If the graphite has worn down completely, take a small hand knife and ""peel"" back the wood to expose fresh graphite. Sometimes the graphite will break, but you can continue carving the wood back carefully again. Wear safety gloves while carving the wood back.</sol2>","N/A"

<goal>How to Set Up a Planted Aquarium</goal>
<sol1>There are aquatic plants that will live in pretty much any aquarium, so it just takes a little research to find plants that will work in yours. The first thing you need to add is substrate. For a heavily planted tank with more demanding species of plants, there are special aquarium soils that come in different sized granules. For less demanding species, you can just use sand. Build up the substrate in the back of the tank to add some dimension, and have it lower in the front. You want to avoid making your substrate too deep because you can end up with spots of anaerobic bacteria and gas pockets. Lay a plastic shopping bag over top of the substrate and add the water, pouring on the bag to keep sand from being washed into the water column. Plant taller background plants in the back of the tank, careful not to block where the filter and heater will go, and medium sized plants in the midground, and short or carpeting plants in the front. Make sure your aquarium light is of adequate intensity and spectrum for the plants you have selected. Do water changes of 20% every other day for the first 2 or 3 weeks after starting your aquarium to manage diatoms and remove decaying plant matter and mulm. Do not fertilize during this period, and if your light has a dimmer, its a good idea to reduce the intensity until the plants have a change to acclimate. This will help avoid any unwanted algae issues.</sol1>

<goal>What is the best music to help you get to sleep?</goal>
<sol1>A dampened environment may improve sleep.</sol1>
<sol2>Most people surveyed seem to find soft classical music very good before sleep, as it has a lulling effect and can slow heart rate and respiration, helping to induce sleep. Some works by Mozart and Handel are popular and many classical composers wrote lullabies that are perfect for this purpose. But it's fun to experiment with various types of audio, including wind and water sounds, sometimes called white noise, to find what works the best for you.White noise dampens out other disturbing noises that might be keeping you from falling asleep easily.</sol2>","N/A"
